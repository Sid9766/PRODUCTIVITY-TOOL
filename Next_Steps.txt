Next Steps To Take

A dropdown menu to choose capsules, for example the older capsules, to understand what might have been done earlier.
Store chat history for each session.
Visualization of capusle insights.
Maybe try to add to some authentication and password protected access to the UI
Maybe a sidebar to adjust various parameters like: Temperature, Max Tokens, Compression Budget,etc.

Now this needs further thinking, but maybe also try to integrate Autogen here to allow the agent to auto-suggest questions from the capsule.
