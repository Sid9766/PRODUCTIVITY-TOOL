# PRODUCTIVITY-TOOL
A lightweight local system that monitors your work across applications, builds a capsule of your activity, and uses LLMs to help you resume where you left off.
The core insight is simple: as knowledge workers, we switch between tools — PowerPoint, VS Code, browsers — and when we return, we often ask ourselves: ‘Where did I leave off?’ This system solves that.
